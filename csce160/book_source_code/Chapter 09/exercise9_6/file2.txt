Computers can perform such a wide variety of tasks because they can be programmed. This
means that computers are not designed to do just one job, but to do any job that their pro-
grams tell them to do. A program is a set of instructions that a computer follows to perform
a task. For example, Figure 1-1 shows screens using Microsoft Word and PowerPoint, two
commonly used programs.
Programs are commonly referred to as software. Software is essential to a computer because
it controls everything the computer does. All of the software that we use to make our com-
puters useful is created by individuals working as programmers or software developers. A
programmer, or software developer, is a person with the training and skills necessary to
design, create, and test computer programs. Computer programming is an exciting and
rewarding career. Today, you will find programmers’ work used in business, medicine, gov-
ernment, law enforcement, agriculture, academics, entertainment, and many other fields.
